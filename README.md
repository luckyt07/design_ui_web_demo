# Project Description

This project involves building a web application that performs specific functionalities related to URL input, image display, and fullscreen toggling using Dart and JavaScript.

## Features

### 1. URL Input Field and Image Display:
- Create an input field for a URL and a button.
- When the button is clicked, an image should appear in the center of the application using an HTML `<img>` element (not a Flutter `Image` widget).
- Double-clicking on the image should toggle the browser's fullscreen mode. This is done using JavaScript functions called directly from Dart.

### 2. "Plus" Button and Context Menu:
- Add a button with a "Plus" icon to the bottom-right corner of the screen.
- Clicking on this button should display a context menu with "Enter fullscreen" and "Exit fullscreen" buttons above it.
- When the menu is open, the background should dim while the button and menu remain highlighted.
- Clicking outside the menu should close it, and clicking the menu buttons should perform the corresponding action and close the menu.

## Final Result:
- Submit your code as a link to a GitHub repository.
- Deploy the compiled web version of the application on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
- Ensure the code is formatted and documented according to the guidelines in [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/effective-dart/documentation).
